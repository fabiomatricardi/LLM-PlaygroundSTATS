The Diary of a Young Girl, often referred to as The Diary of Anne Frank, is a book of the writings from the Dutch-language diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Anne's diaries were retrieved by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl. Miep gave them to Anne's father, Otto Frank, the family's only survivor, just after the Second World War was over.
The diary has since been published in more than 70 languages. First published under the title Het Achterhuis. Dagboekbrieven 14 Juni 1942 ‚Äì 1 Augustus 1944 (The Annex: Diary Notes 14 June 1942 ‚Äì 1 August 1944) by Contact Publishing [nl] in Amsterdam in 1947, the diary received widespread critical and popular attention on the appearance of its English language translation, Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl by Doubleday & Company (United States) and Vallentine Mitchell (United Kingdom) in 1952. Its popularity inspired the 1955 play The Diary of Anne Frank by the screenwriters Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, which they adapted for the screen for the 1959 movie version. The book is included in several lists of the top books of the 20th century
In the manuscript, her original diaries are written over three extant volumes. The first volume (the red-and-white checkered autograph book) covers the period between 14 June and 5 December 1942. Since the second surviving volume (a school exercise book) begins on 22 December 1943, and ends on 17 April 1944, it is assumed that the original volume or volumes between December 1942 and December 1943 were lost, presumably after the arrest, when the hiding place was emptied on Nazi instructions. However, this missing period is covered in the version Anne rewrote for preservation. The third existing volume (which was also a school exercise book) contains entries from 17 April to 1 August 1944, when Anne wrote for the last time three days before her arrest.‚Ää
The manuscript, written on loose sheets of paper, was found strewn on the floor of the hiding place by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl after the family's arrest,[22] but before their rooms were ransacked by a special department of the Amsterdam office of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD, Nazi intelligence agency) for which many Dutch collaborators worked.[23] The papers were given to Otto Frank after the war, when Anne's death was confirmed in July 1945 by sisters Janny and Lien Brilleslijper, who were with Margot and Anne in Bergen-Belsen.

Text: """The Diary of a Young Girl, often referred to as The Diary of Anne Frank, is a book of the writings from the Dutch-language diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Anne's diaries were retrieved by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl. Miep gave them to Anne's father, Otto Frank, the family's only survivor, just after the Second World War was over.
The diary has since been published in more than 70 languages. First published under the title Het Achterhuis. Dagboekbrieven 14 Juni 1942 ‚Äì 1 Augustus 1944 (The Annex: Diary Notes 14 June 1942 ‚Äì 1 August 1944) by Contact Publishing [nl] in Amsterdam in 1947, the diary received widespread critical and popular attention on the appearance of its English language translation, Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl by Doubleday & Company (United States) and Vallentine Mitchell (United Kingdom) in 1952. Its popularity inspired the 1955 play The Diary of Anne Frank by the screenwriters Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, which they adapted for the screen for the 1959 movie version. The book is included in several lists of the top books of the 20th century. In the manuscript, her original diaries are written over three extant volumes. The first volume (the red-and-white checkered autograph book) covers the period between 14 June and 5 December 1942. Since the second surviving volume (a school exercise book) begins on 22 December 1943, and ends on 17 April 1944, it is assumed that the original volume or volumes between December 1942 and December 1943 were lost, presumably after the arrest, when the hiding place was emptied on Nazi instructions. However, this missing period is covered in the version Anne rewrote for preservation. The third existing volume (which was also a school exercise book) contains entries from 17 April to 1 August 1944, when Anne wrote for the last time three days before her arrest.‚Ää The manuscript, written on loose sheets of paper, was found strewn on the floor of the hiding place by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl after the family's arrest,[22] but before their rooms were ransacked by a special department of the Amsterdam office of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD, Nazi intelligence agency) for which many Dutch collaborators worked.[23] The papers were given to Otto Frank after the war, when Anne's death was confirmed in July 1945 by sisters Janny and Lien Brilleslijper, who were with Margot and Anne in Bergen-Belsen.."""

Why Flan-T5 is it superior to GPT-3? 
For several reasons:
- GPT-3 is a model with a high degree of popularity, but to test it and use it correctly, we need a huge computing budget that can seldom be found in a regular home. We need power in our computers that is not easy to get. However, FLAN-T5 does not need large devices because its smaller models/checkpoints are created for the common citizen.
- It detects sarcasm and is very intuitive. It is able to reinterpret the questions.
- Tested with an input of 5 examples into FLAN-T5 XL (5-shot), the 3 billion model outperforms GPT-3. In fact, there are not many examples to give it and he is very good with the zero-shot.

answer the following yes/no questions by reasoning step-by-step given the following text:

For a machine learning model to generate meaningful text, it must have a large amount of knowledge about the world as well as the ability to abstract. While language models that are trained to do this are increasingly able to automatically acquire this knowledge as they scale, how to best unlock this knowledge and apply it to specific real-world tasks is not clear.
One well-established technique for doing this is called fine-tuning, which is training a pretrained model such as BERT and T5 on a labeled dataset to adapt it to a downstream task. However, fine-tuning requires a large number of training examples, along with stored model weights for each downstream task, which is not always practical, particularly for large models.
In ‚ÄúFine-tuned Language Models Are Zero-Shot Learners‚Äù, we explore a simple technique called instruction fine-tuning, or instruction tuning for short. This involves fine-tuning a model not to solve a specific task, but to make it more amenable to solving NLP tasks in general. We use instruction tuning to train a model, which we call Fine-tuned LAnguage Net (FLAN). Because the instruction tuning phase of FLAN only takes a small number of updates compared to the large amount of computation involved in pre-training the model, it's the metaphorical dessert to the main course of pretraining. This enables FLAN to perform various unseen tasks.

Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts. Language models have become an important and flexible building block in a variety of user-facing language technologies, including conversational interfaces, search and summarization, and collaborative writing. These models perform downstream tasks primarily via prompting: all relevant task specification and data to process is formatted as a textual context, and the model returns a generated text completion. These input contexts can contain thousands of tokens, especially when using language models on lengthy inputs (e.g., legal or scientific documents, conversation histories, etc.) or augmenting them with external information (e.g.,relevant documents from a search engine, database query results, etc; Petroni et al., 2020; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023, inter alia). Handling these use-cases requires language models to successfully operate over long sequences. Figure 1: Changing the location of relevant information
(in this case, the position of the passage that answers an input question) within the language model‚Äôs input context results in a U-shaped performance curve‚Äîmodels are better at using relevant information that occurs at the very beginning or end of its input context, and performance degrades significantly when models must access and use information located in the middle of its input context. For example, GPT-3.5-Turbo‚Äôs open-book performance on the multi-document question task when relevant information is placed in the middle of its input context is lower than its performance when predicting without any documents (i.e., the closed-book setting; 56.1%). See Figure 5 for full results. Language models are generally implemented with Transformers, which scale poorly to long sequences (e.g., since self-attention complexity is quadratic with the input sequence length). As a result, language models are typically trained with relatively small context windows.

Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts. Language models have become an important and flexible building block in a variety of user-facing language technologies, including conversational interfaces, search and summarization, and collaborative writing. These models perform downstream tasks primarily via prompting: all relevant task specification and data to process is formatted as a textual context, and the model returns a generated text completion. These input contexts can contain thousands of tokens, especially when using language models on lengthy inputs (e.g., legal or scientific documents, conversation histories, etc.) or augmenting them with external information (e.g.,relevant documents from a search engine, database query results, etc; Petroni et al., 2020; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023, inter alia).

Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts. Language models have become an important and flexible building block in a variety of user-facing language technologies, including conversational interfaces, search and summarization, and collaborative writing. These models perform downstream tasks primarily via prompting: all relevant task specification and data to process is formatted as a textual context, and the model returns a generated text completion. These input contexts can contain thousands of tokens, especially when using language models on lengthy inputs (e.g., legal or scientific documents, conversation histories, etc.) or augmenting them with external information (e.g.,relevant documents from a search engine, database query results, etc; Petroni et al., 2020; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023, inter alia).

ARTICLE:\ Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts. Language models have become an important and flexible building block in a variety of user-facing language technologies, including conversational interfaces, search and summarization, and collaborative writing. These models perform downstream tasks primarily via prompting: all relevant task specification and data to process is formatted as a textual context, and the model returns a generated text completion. These input contexts can contain thousands of tokens, especially when using language models on lengthy inputs (e.g., legal or scientific documents, conversation histories, etc.) or augmenting them with external information (e.g.,relevant documents from a search engine, database query results, etc; Petroni et al., 2020; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023, inter alia). Handling these use-cases requires language models to successfully operate over long sequences. Figure 1: Changing the location of relevant information (in this case, the position of the passage that answers an input question) within the language model‚Äôs input context results in a U-shaped performance curve‚Äîmodels are better at using relevant information that occurs at the very beginning or end of its input context, and performance degrades significantly when models must access and use information located in the middle of its input context. For example, GPT-3.5-Turbo‚Äôs open-book performance on the multi-document question task when relevant information is placed in the middle of its input context is lower than its performance when predicting without any documents (i.e., the closed-book setting; 56.1%). See Figure 5 for full results. Language models are generally implemented with Transformers, which scale poorly to long sequences (e.g., since self-attention complexity is quadratic with the input sequence length). As a result, language models are typically trained with relatively small context windows.\

For example, GPT-3.5-Turbo‚Äôs open-book performance on the multi-document question task when relevant information is placed in the middle of its input context is lower than its performance when predicting without any documents (i.e., the closed-book setting; 56.1%).

Sheared LLaMA: Accelerating Language Model Pre-training via Structured Pruning. The popularity of LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) and other recently emerged moderate-sized large language models (LLMs) highlights the potential of building smaller yet powerful LLMs. Regardless, the cost of training such models from scratch on trillions of tokens remains high. In this work, we study structured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller LLMs from pre-trained, larger models. Our approach employs two key techniques: (1) targeted structured pruning, which prunes a larger model to a specified target shape by removing layers, heads, and intermediate and hidden dimensions in an end-to-end manner, and (2) dynamic batch loading, which dynamically updates the composition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses across different domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting the Sheared-LLaMA series, pruning the LLaMA2-7B model down to 1.3B and 2.7B parameters. Sheared-LLaMA models outperform state-of-the-art open-source models of equivalent sizes, such as Pythia, INCITE, and OpenLLaMA models, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations, while requiring only 3% of compute compared to training such models from scratch. This work provides compelling evidence that leveraging existing LLMs with structured pruning is a far more cost-effective approach for building smaller LLMs.

Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts. Language models have become an important and flexible building block in a variety of user-facing language technologies, including conversational interfaces, search and summarization, and collaborative writing. These models perform downstream tasks primarily via prompting: all relevant task specification and data to process is formatted as a textual context, and the model returns a generated text completion. These input contexts can contain thousands of tokens, especially when using language models on lengthy inputs (e.g., legal or scientific documents, conversation histories, etc.) or augmenting them with external information (e.g.,relevant documents from a search engine, database query results, etc; Petroni et al., 2020; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023, inter alia). Handling these use-cases requires language models to successfully operate over long sequences. Figure 1: Changing the location of relevant information (in this case, the position of the passage that answers an input question) within the language model‚Äôs input context results in a U-shaped performance curve‚Äîmodels are better at using relevant information that occurs at the very beginning or end of its input context, and performance degrades significantly when models must access and use information located in the middle of its input context. 
For example, GPT-3.5-Turbo‚Äôs open-book performance on the multi-document question task when relevant information is placed in the middle of its input context is lower than its performance when predicting without any documents (i.e., the closed-book setting; 56.1%). See Figure 5 for full results. Language models are generally implemented with Transformers, which scale poorly to long sequences (e.g., since self-attention complexity is quadratic with the input sequence length). As a result, language models are typically trained with relatively small context windows.

'''Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts. Language models have become an important and flexible building block in a variety of user-facing language technologies, including conversational interfaces, search and summarization, and collaborative writing. These models perform downstream tasks primarily via prompting: all relevant task specification and data to process is formatted as a textual context, and the model returns a generated text completion. These input contexts can contain thousands of tokens, especially when using language models on lengthy inputs (e.g., legal or scientific documents, conversation histories, etc.) or augmenting them with external information (e.g.,relevant documents from a search engine, database query results, etc; Petroni et al., 2020; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023, inter alia). Handling these use-cases requires language models to successfully operate over long sequences. Figure 1: Changing the location of relevant information (in this case, the position of the passage that answers an input question) within the language model‚Äôs input context results in a U-shaped performance curve‚Äîmodels are better at using relevant information that occurs at the very beginning or end of its input context, and performance degrades significantly when models must access and use information located in the middle of its input context. For example, GPT-3.5-Turbo‚Äôs open-book performance on the multi-document question task when relevant information is placed in the middle of its input context is lower than its performance when predicting without any documents (i.e., the closed-book setting; 56.1%). See Figure 5 for full results. Language models are generally implemented with Transformers, which scale poorly to long sequences (e.g., since self-attention complexity is quadratic with the input sequence length). As a result, language models are typically trained with relatively small context windows.'''
