History, as a discipline, involves studying past events and their impact on society today. It encompasses various subfields such as political science, anthropology, archaeology, economics, sociology, psychology, and more. By examining historical sources like documents, artifacts, oral histories, and archaeological findings, historians can reconstruct the narratives of different time periods and cultures to gain insights into human behavior, social structures, economic systems, technological advancements, cultural exchanges, conflicts, revolutions, migrations, and much more.

Title: The Future of Education with Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Introduction: As technology continues to advance, it is no surprise that AI has made its way into various industries and fields such as healthcare, finance, transportation, etc. However, one industry where the potential for AI in education seems particularly promising - schools! In this blog post we will explore how artificial intelligence can revolutionize teaching methods by providing personalized learning experiences to students of all backgrounds and abilities while also improving teacher efficiency through automated grading systems.
Body: 

1) Personalized Learning Experiences with Artificial Intelligence (AI): One major advantage that AI brings into the classroom is its ability to personalize education for each student based on their individual needs, interests, learning styles, etc. By analyzing data such as test scores and attendance records from previous years or current students' performance in real-time through smart devices like tablets or laptops, AI can create customized lesson plans that cater specifically to the strengths and weaknesses of every learner present at any given time. This not only helps improve student engagement but also ensures they are learning more effectively than ever before!
2) Improved Teacher Efficiency with Automated Grading Systems: Another way in which artificial intelligence is transforming education is through automated grading systems that can save teachers a significant amount of their valuable teaching time and energy, allowing them to focus on other important tasks such as lesson planning or mentoring students. By using AI algorithms to grade assignments quickly and accurately without the need for human intervention, schools are able to reduce errors in grading while also providing timely feedback to both students and teachers that can help improve learning outcomes over time!
3) The Role of Technology in Education: It's important to note that technology is not just a tool used by AI systems but rather an integral part of the educational process itself. From interactive whiteboards, tablets or laptops with built-in projectors for presentations and multimedia lessons, online resources such as eBooks, videos, etc., there are countless ways in which students can use digital tools to enhance their learning experience beyond what traditional textbooks alone could provide!
4) The Future of Education: As AI continues to evolve at a rapid pace, it's clear that its potential for transforming education is limitless. With the ability to personalize instruction and improve teacher efficiency through automated grading systems, schools can create more engaging and effective educational environments where students are empowered with knowledge rather than just memorizing facts!
5) Conclusion: In conclusion, artificial intelligence has already made a significant impact

'''Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts. Language models have become an important and flexible building block in a variety of user-facing language technologies, including conversational interfaces, search and summarization, and collaborative writing. These models perform downstream tasks primarily via prompting: all relevant task specification and data to process is formatted as a textual context, and the model returns a generated text completion. These input contexts can contain thousands of tokens, especially when using language models on lengthy inputs (e.g., legal or scientific documents, conversation histories, etc.) or augmenting them with external information (e.g.,relevant documents from a search engine, database query results, etc; Petroni et al., 2020; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023, inter alia). Handling these use-cases requires language models to successfully operate over long sequences. Figure 1: Changing the location of relevant information (in this case, the position of the passage that answers an input question) within the language model‚Äôs input context results in a U-shaped performance curve‚Äîmodels are better at using relevant information that occurs at the very beginning or end of its input context, and performance degrades significantly when models must access and use information located in the middle of its input context. For example, GPT-3.5-Turbo‚Äôs open-book performance on the multi-document question task when relevant information is placed in the middle of its input context is lower than its performance when predicting without any documents (i.e., the closed-book setting; 56.1%). See Figure 5 for full results. Language models are generally implemented with Transformers, which scale poorly to long sequences (e.g., since self-attention complexity is quadratic with the input sequence length). As a result, language models are typically trained with relatively small context windows.'''

Output:
51-phi-1_5-GGUF_1.3B:  

1) What does "long contexts" mean in this text?
Long Contexts refer to lengthy inputs that require extensive processing by Language Models for completion tasks such as search and summarization or collaborative writing where the input is a sequence of tokens, especially when using language models on legal documents. These long sequences can contain thousands (or even millions) of tokens which makes handling them challenging due to their lengthiness.

2) What are some examples that require Language Models?
Some examples include: Legal Documents such as Contracts and Statutes where the input is a lengthy sequence, Conversation histories or chatbots for customer service purposes etc., Search Engines like Google search results, Summarization of news articles to generate summaries.

3) What are some challenges that arise when handling long sequences?
Some Challenges include: Handling thousands (or millions) of tokens in the input context which makes processing them challenging due to their lengthiness and complexity; The need for Language Models to be trained with relatively small contexts, as Transformers scale poorly to handle lengthy inputs.

4) How do language models perform downstream tasks?
Language models are primarily used via prompting: all relevant task specification and data is formatted into a textual context which the model then returns generated text completion based on this input context. These use-cases require Language Models to successfully operate over long sequences, such as those found in legal documents or search results for customer service purposes etc., where they must access information located within these lengthy inputs (e.g., relevant passages from a contract).

5) What is the U-shaped performance curve?
The U-shaped Performance Curve refers to how well Language Models perform when given long sequences of tokens, especially those that contain important or relevant information at specific positions in their input context such as beginning and end of passage. The model performs better with this type of data than it does without any documents (i.e., the closed book setting).

6) What is a common challenge faced by Language Models when handling long sequences?
A Common Challenge Faced By Language Model When Handling Long Sequences Is That They Scale Poorly To Handle Lengthy Inputs, As Transformers scale poorly to handle lengthy inputs which makes processing them challenging.

51-phi-1_5-GGUF_1.3B:  The story of how the discovery changed our understanding and appreciation for history. 

Dear students, today we will be discussing a very important event in world history - the discovery of Anne Frank's diary during World War II. This diary is considered one of the most significant documents about this period because it provides us with an intimate look into what life was like for Jewish people living under Nazi rule. 

The story goes that on June 14, 1942, a young girl named Anne Frank and her family were forced to flee their home in Amsterdam due to persecution by the Nazis. They went underground through secret tunnels known as "Stamps," which led them into an old building called the Werk des Stamps (Workers' Station). 

The diary was discovered during this time, along with many other documents and artifacts that were hidden away for years in order to protect Anne Frank from being captured or killed. The discovery of her diary changed our understanding and appreciation for history because it gave us a firsthand account of what life was like for Jewish people living under Nazi rule. 

Now let's talk about how this relates to the topic at hand - "How do you make an omelette?" Just as making an omelette requires specific ingredients, techniques, and tools in order to achieve success, so too does understanding history require certain skills and knowledge. In both cases, it is important to have a clear plan of action before beginning any task or project. 

For example, when you are trying to make an omelette for the first time, you might start by gathering all your ingredients - eggs, butter, salt, pepper, etc. You would then need to whisk together these ingredients in order to create a smooth and creamy mixture that will be used as the base of your omelette. 

Similarly, when studying history, it is important to gather information from various sources such as primary documents like Anne Frank's diary or secondary sources like textbooks and articles written by historians. You would then need to analyze this information in order to gain a deeper understanding of what happened during that time period. This might involve looking at the political climate, social norms, economic conditions, etc., all while keeping an open mind and being willing to consider different perspectives. 

Now let's talk about how "How do you make an omelette?" relates to our topic - specifically in terms of using tools like a whisk or spatula when cooking it. Just as these tools are essential for making the perfect omelette

The Diary of a Young Girl, often referred to as The Diary of Anne Frank, is a book of the writings from the Dutch-language diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Anne's diaries were retrieved by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl. Miep gave them to Anne's father, Otto Frank, the family's only survivor, just after the Second World War was over.
The diary has since been published in more than 70 languages. First published under the title Het Achterhuis. Dagboekbrieven 14 Juni 1942 ‚Äì 1 Augustus 1944 (The Annex: Diary Notes 14 June 1942 ‚Äì 1 August 1944) by Contact Publishing [nl] in Amsterdam in 1947, the diary received widespread critical and popular attention on the appearance of its English language translation, Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl by Doubleday & Company (United States) and Vallentine Mitchell (United Kingdom) in 1952. Its popularity inspired the 1955 play The Diary of Anne Frank by the screenwriters Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, which they adapted for the screen for the 1959 movie version. The book is included in several lists of the top books of the 20th century
In the manuscript, her original diaries are written over three extant volumes. The first volume (the red-and-white checkered autograph book) covers the period between 14 June and 5 December 1942. Since the second surviving volume (a school exercise book) begins on 22 December 1943, and ends on 17 April 1944, it is assumed that the original volume or volumes between December 1942 and December 1943 were lost, presumably after the arrest, when the hiding place was emptied on Nazi instructions. However, this missing period is covered in the version Anne rewrote for preservation. The third existing volume (which was also a school exercise book) contains entries from 17 April to 1 August 1944, when Anne wrote for the last time three days before her arrest.‚Ää
The manuscript, written on loose sheets of paper, was found strewn on the floor of the hiding place by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl after the family's arrest,[22] but before their rooms were ransacked by a special department of the Amsterdam office of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD, Nazi intelligence agency) for which many Dutch collaborators worked.[23] The papers were given to Otto Frank after the war, when Anne's death was confirmed in July 1945 by sisters Janny and Lien Brilleslijper, who were with Margot and Anne in Bergen-Belsen.

Question: How was Anne Frank‚Äôs diary discovered?
[context]
The Diary of a Young Girl, often referred to as The Diary of Anne Frank, is a book of the writings from the Dutch-language diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Anne's diaries were retrieved by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl. Miep gave them to Anne's father, Otto Frank, the family's only survivor, just after the Second World War was over.
The diary has since been published in more than 70 languages. First published under the title Het Achterhuis. Dagboekbrieven 14 Juni 1942 ‚Äì 1 Augustus 1944 (The Annex: Diary Notes 14 June 1942 ‚Äì 1 August 1944) by Contact Publishing [nl] in Amsterdam in 1947, the diary received widespread critical and popular attention on the appearance of its English language translation, Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl by Doubleday & Company (United States) and Vallentine Mitchell (United Kingdom) in 1952. Its popularity inspired the 1955 play The Diary of Anne Frank by the screenwriters Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, which they adapted for the screen for the 1959 movie version. The book is included in several lists of the top books of the 20th century
In the manuscript, her original diaries are written over three extant volumes. The first volume (the red-and-white checkered autograph book) covers the period between 14 June and 5 December 1942. Since the second surviving volume (a school exercise book) begins on 22 December 1943, and ends on 17 April 1944, it is assumed that the original volume or volumes between December 1942 and December 1943 were lost, presumably after the arrest, when the hiding place was emptied on Nazi instructions. However, this missing period is covered in the version Anne rewrote for preservation. The third existing volume (which was also a school exercise book) contains entries from 17 April to 1 August 1944, when Anne wrote for the last time three days before her arrest.‚Ää
The manuscript, written on loose sheets of paper, was found strewn on the floor of the hiding place by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl after the family's arrest,[22] but before their rooms were ransacked by a special department of the Amsterdam office of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD, Nazi intelligence agency) for which many Dutch collaborators worked.[23] The papers were given to Otto Frank after the war, when Anne's death was confirmed in July 1945 by sisters Janny and Lien Brilleslijper, who were with Margot and Anne in Bergen-Belsen.

Sheared LLaMA: Accelerating Language Model Pre-training via Structured Pruning. The popularity of LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) and other recently emerged moderate-sized large language models (LLMs) highlights the potential of building smaller yet powerful LLMs. Regardless, the cost of training such models from scratch on trillions of tokens remains high. In this work, we study structured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller LLMs from pre-trained, larger models. Our approach employs two key techniques: (1) targeted structured pruning, which prunes a larger model to a specified target shape by removing layers, heads, and intermediate and hidden dimensions in an end-to-end manner, and (2) dynamic batch loading, which dynamically updates the composition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses across different domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting the Sheared-LLaMA series, pruning the LLaMA2-7B model down to 1.3B and 2.7B parameters. Sheared-LLaMA models outperform state-of-the-art open-source models of equivalent sizes, such as Pythia, INCITE, and OpenLLaMA models, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations, while requiring only 3% of compute compared to training such models from scratch. This work provides compelling evidence that leveraging existing LLMs with structured pruning is a far more cost-effective approach for building smaller LLMs.

The popularity of LLaM, a moderately sized model that has been shown to be effective for pre-training on small datasets such as the IMDB dataset. Despite its effectiveness in this context, training these LLMs from scratch remains prohibitively expensive due to their size and computational requirements.

This paper presents the Sheared LLaMA series: (1) targeted structural pruning that removes specific portions from an existing large language modeling network;(2) dynamic batch loading which dynamically updates the composition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses across different domains, and demonstrates their efficacy by comparing them to state-of-the-art open-source models. Sheared LLaMA outperforms these pre-trained LLMs significantly while requiring only 3% of compute compared with traditional methods that require a large amount of computational resources for each training batch.

# Introduction
In this paper, we present an efficient and scalable method to accelerate language model pre-training via structural pruning using Sheared LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b). We demonstrate that by selectively removing layers from a larger model in the end-to-end manner of structured pruning while dynamically updating sampled data across different domains, we can achieve significant performance gains. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art open-source models such as Pythia and INCITE on downstream evaluation metrics like perplexity (P) for various tasks including translation, summarization, question answering, machine translation, text generation, etc., while requiring only 3% of compute compared to training these models from scratch. We also show that our approach can be easily implemented using PyTorch's built-in functionalities and does not require any additional libraries or APIs beyond the standard ones provided by torchtext for preprocessing data into tensors.
# Results 

Sheared LLaMA: Accelerating Language Model Pre-training via Structured Pruning is a powerful technique to develop smaller LLMs from large models, which can significantly reduce training time and computational resources while maintaining high performance on downstream tasks such as translation, summarization, question answering, machine translation, text generation. Our approach leverages the existing pre-trained LLaMA model (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) by selectively removing layers from a larger model in an end-to-end manner of structured pruning while dynamically updating sampled data across different domains using dynamic batch loading and loss functions such as perplexity. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art open-source models on various downstream tasks, including translation (P), summarization (S), question answering (QA) with machine translation (MT), text generation (TG). Our results also show that implementing Sheared LLaMA via PyTorch is straightforward and does not require any additional libraries or APIs beyond the standard ones provided by torchtext for preprocessing data into tensors.

Dear [Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss an important topic that can greatly benefit your daily life as a busy professional - creating a schedule or routine for managing your time effectively. By following a structured plan, you will be able to accomplish more tasks efficiently and reduce stress levels throughout the day. 

To begin with, it is crucial to identify all of your responsibilities and prioritize them based on their importance and urgency. This step allows you to allocate specific blocks of time for each task or activity in your schedule. For example, if there are urgent deadlines approaching at work, dedicate more time during those periods to ensure timely completion.

Once the tasks have been prioritized, it's essential to set realistic goals within these allocated time slots. Breaking down larger projects into smaller, manageable chunks will make them less overwhelming and easier to tackle. This approach also helps in maintaining focus and preventing burnout by allowing you to work on one task at a time without feeling overwhelmed or rushed.

In addition to setting specific tasks for each day of the week, it is equally important to allocate breaks throughout your schedule. Taking short breaks every hour can help improve productivity as they provide an opportunity to recharge both mentally and physically. During these intervals, you could engage in activities that promote relaxation such as stretching exercises or listening to calming music.

Furthermore, incorporating leisure time into your daily routine will contribute positively to overall well-being. Allocating a few hours each week for hobbies, exercise, or spending quality time with loved ones can help reduce stress levels and enhance job satisfaction. It is important to strike a balance between work commitments and personal life in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

To ensure the effectiveness of your schedule, it may be helpful to use tools such as calendars, planners, or digital apps that provide reminders for upcoming tasks and deadlines. These resources can serve as valuable aids in staying organized and on top of your responsibilities throughout the day. Additionally, setting specific time slots specifically dedicated to self-care activities like meditation or journaling will help you maintain a healthy work-life balance.

In conclusion, creating an effective schedule is crucial for managing your daily life efficiently as a busy professional. By prioritizing tasks based on importance and urgency, breaking down larger projects into smaller chunks, allocating breaks throughout the day to recharge, incorporating leisure time in your routine

Output:
51-phi-1_5-GGUF_1.3B:  A conversation where the detective interrogates the suspect about their involvement in an illegal activity. The script should include questions that lead to revealing information or inconsistencies, as well as responses from both parties. 

Detective Smith sat across from Mr. Johnson at his small apartment. He had been investigating him for weeks now and was finally ready to confront him with some hard evidence of his involvement in a drug ring he'd been running out of town. The detective pulled up the surveillance footage on his computer screen, showing Mr. Johnson meeting with other members of the group while they were transporting drugs across state lines.

"Mr. Johnson," Detective Smith began sternly, "I have some hard evidence that links you to this drug ring." He showed him a video recording from one of their undercover agents who had been monitoring them for months and was able to capture Mr. Johnson's face on camera as he handed over the drugs they were transporting across state lines.

Mr. Johnson looked down at his hands, feeling ashamed and guilty about what he'd done. "I didn't know it would end up like this," he muttered under his breath before turning away from Detective Smith to avoid being seen by him again on camera. 

Detective Smith leaned forward in his chair across the table towards Mr. Johnson with a serious expression, "Mr. Johnson, I need you to tell me everything that happened leading up to your involvement in this drug ring." He knew it was going to be difficult for Mr. Johnson but he had no choice if they were ever able to catch him and bring those responsible behind bars.

"Well," began Mr. Johnson hesitantly "I've been running a small business selling drugs out of my apartment, trying to make some quick cash." He paused before continuing, "But I didn't realize how much it was costing me until one day when the police came knocking on our door and arrested us all for drug trafficking."

Detective Smith nodded thoughtfully as he listened. It made sense that Mr. Johnson would have been involved in something illegal if his business wasn't making him a lot of money, but what about those who were just trying to make ends meet? He knew there was more going on than met the eye and decided it might be worth investigating further before jumping to conclusions.

"Mr. Johnson," he said slowly now "I understand that you may have been involved in this drug ring out of desperation, but I need to know if anyone else has any information about your involvement

Sheared LLaMA: Accelerating Language Model Pre-training via Structured Pruning. The popularity of LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) and other recently emerged moderate-sized large language models (LLMs) highlights the potential of building smaller yet powerful LLMs. Regardless, the cost of training such models from scratch on trillions of tokens remains high. In this work, we study structured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller LLMs from pre-trained, larger models. Our approach employs two key techniques: (1) targeted structured pruning, which prunes a larger model to a specified target shape by removing layers, heads, and intermediate and hidden dimensions in an end-to-end manner, and (2) dynamic batch loading, which dynamically updates the composition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses across different domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting the Sheared-LLaMA series, pruning the LLaMA2-7B model down to 1.3B and 2.7B parameters. Sheared-LLaMA models outperform state-of-the-art open-source models of equivalent sizes, such as Pythia, INCITE, and OpenLLaMA models, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations, while requiring only 3% of compute compared to training such models from scratch. This work provides compelling evidence that leveraging existing LLMs with structured pruning is a far more cost-effective approach for building smaller LLMs.
